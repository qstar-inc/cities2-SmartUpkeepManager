	<LongDescription>
# Smart Upkeep Manager
Get balanced upkeep cost for all service buildings dependant on various functions provided by the building.

Each factor is manually set with a predefined default value, but it's also possible to change every factors rates.
All values can also be set to 0 too, making all upkeep free.

# All options are optional.

If you think some values are very out of balance and just changing the sliders won't make difference, feel free to reach out.

- Does not modify the save itself. Removing the mod will revert everything back to vanilla.
